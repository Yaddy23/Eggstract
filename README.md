# Eggstract
Automated Egg Incubator

Eggstract is an incubator created to alleviate majority of the difficulties in hatching fighting cocks. 
This project provides new insights into the automated egg incubation process for fighting cocks, filling a gap in the existing literature on egg incubation technology.
With Eggstract, breeders can take advantage of modern technology to improve their operations and achieve better results. 
We hope to provide insight on the benefits of automation and modern technology integration onto the agriculture industry and other scientific projects.
